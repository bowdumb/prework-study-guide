# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- The motivation behind this project was the opportunity to practice and further our knowledge of the foundational concepts covered in the Georgia Tech Professional Education Coding Bootcamp.
- This study guide was created with the intention of providing additional resources when studying and practicing the pre-work material for the Georgia Tech Professional Education Coding Bootcamp.
- This study guide should provide the user with a place to store their notes and review their progress.
- Through the creation of this project I learned foundational concepts within the languages of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, as well as Git and the use of GitHub as a remote repository for version control.

## Usage

The Pre-work Study Guide can be used as an evolving hub for referencing the lessons the user has covered regarding the topics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. The user will find separate categories for adding to or modifiying HTML code in order tailor these respective sections of the study guide to their needs. Open the Chrome DevTools by pressing "Command+Option+J" on Mac in order to bug test code or view our JavaScript console.log results in order to have a random topic picked to study.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
